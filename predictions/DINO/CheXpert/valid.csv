/CheXpert-v1.0-512/images/train/patient41636/study2/view1_frontal.jpg,"NARRATIVE:
EXAM: Chest 2 Views, 9/6/2020
 
CLINICAL HISTORY: Female of 88 years. Reason for study: ""SOB"" 
 
COMPARISON: 9/6/2020 chest x-ray, 9/6/2020 CT lumbar spine.  CT chest 
abdomen pelvis 9/6/2020
 
FINDINGS:
 
Slightly low lung volumes.  Vague left retrocardiac opacity is more 
conspicuous on current examination, possibly related to underlying 
hiatal hernia which is seen to better advantage on frontal projection 
and on cross-sectional imaging of 11/25/15.  No significant pleural 
effusions.  
 
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed.  A 
valvular prosthesis is noted.  There is moderate cardiomegaly and 
atherosclerotic change of the thoracic aorta.  The thoracic aorta is 
also noted to be tortuous, not significantly changed.  Pulmonary 
vascularity is within normal limits. The trachea is similar in 
configuration. 
 
Generalized osteopenia.  A compression deformity is noted in a lumbar 
vertebral body, new since 11-25-2015.  
 
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1.VAGUE LEFT RETROCARDIAC OPACITY WHICH MAY REPRESENT A DEVELOPING 
INFILTRATE.  THIS FINDING MAY REPRESENT AN EVOLVING PNEUMONIA IN THE 
APPROPRIATE CLINICAL SETTING.  ALTERNATIVELY, THIS MAY REPRESENT 
KNOWN HIATAL HERNIA IN THIS LOCATION.
 
2.SLIGHTLY LOW LUNG VOLUMES ARE AGAIN DEMONSTRATED.
 
3.A COMPRESSION DEFORMITY IS NOTED IN A LOWER LUMBAR SPINE VERTEBRAL 
BODY, WITH MODERATE LOSS OF HEIGHT.  THIS FINDING IS NEW SINCE 11-25-15 
AND IS OF INDETERMINATE AGE.  RECOMMEND CLINICAL CORRELATION FOR ANY 
SITES OF TENDERNESS.  
 
SUMMARY: 4-POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTION

EXAM: Chest 1 View, 3-30-13
 
CLINICAL HISTORY: Wheezing
 
COMPARISON: None
 
TECHNIQUE: Single frontal view chest
 
FINDINGS: Mild diffuse reticular opacities are seen throughout both 
lungs and could reflect mild pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral 
pleural effusions are present.  There is subtle confluent 
retrocardiac airspace opacity, which could reflect atelectasis or 
early infection.  Postsurgical changes compatible with CABG are seen, 
including mediastinal clips and median sternotomy wires.  Heart size 
is within normal limits.  There is irregularity and lucency within 
the right humeral head and glenoid, along with deformity of the 
humeral head.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1.MILD DIFFUSE RETICULAR OPACITIES ARE SEEN THROUGHOUT BOTH LUNGS AND 
COULD REFLECT MILD PULMONARY EDEMA.  SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL 
EFFUSIONS.
 
2.SUBTLE RETROCARDIAC AIRSPACE OPACITY COULD REFLECT ATELECTASIS OR 
EARLY CONSOLIDATION.
 
3.DEFORMITY AND IRREGULAR LUCENCY IS SEEN THROUGHOUT THE RIGHT 
HUMERAL HEAD AND RIGHT GLENOID.  CORRELATE WITH HISTORY OF TRAUMA OR 
MALIGNANCY.  IF CLINICALLY WARRANTED, CONSIDER DEDICATED VIEWS OF THE 
RIGHT SHOULDER.
 
 
SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTION

FINDINGS:
An endotracheal tube is present approximately 3 cm above the
carina. Nasogastric tube is in position. A right IJ lien has its
distal tip in the region of the SVC. The cardiac silhouette is
within normal limits for this supine projection. There is moderate
prominence of the pulmonary vascularity. There is some patchy left
basilar consolidation.
IMPRESSION:
1. MULTIPLE TUBES AND LINES.
2. RELATIVELY LOW LUNG VOLUMES WITH SOME LEFT BASILAR
CONSOLIDATION.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  03-2015 X2
 
CLINICAL HISTORY:  36-year-old female status post first rib 
resection, evaluate for pneumothorax. 
 
COMPARISON:  None. 
 
FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest obtained 3-11-2015 at 1128 
hours demonstrates a moderate right apical pneumothorax.  Soft tissue 
emphysema projects over the right neck.  Small right apical pleural 
opacity may represent hematoma.  The right first rib has been 
resected. 
 
Subsequent single frontal view of the chest obtained 3-11-15 at 1736 
hours demonstrates interval increase in subcutaneous emphysema 
projecting over the neck and right lateral chest wall.  The right 
lung appears reexpanded without evidence of pneumothorax.  Persistent 
small right apical opacity.  The lungs remain otherwise clear.  
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
1.  SERIES OF TWO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS DEMONSTRATES A RIGHT APICAL 
PNEUMOTHORAX, WHICH HAS REEXPANDED ON THE FOLLOWUP STUDY.  INTERVAL 
INCREASE IN SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA PROJECTING OVER THE NECK AND RIGHT 
LATERAL CHEST WALL.  
 
2.  SMALL RIGHT APICAL PLEURAL OPACITY LIKELY REPRESENTS HEMATOMA.  
THE LUNGS APPEAR OTHERWISE CLEAR.  NO EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT 
EFFUSIONS OR PULMONARY EDEMA. 
 
3.  THE RIGHT FIRST RIB HAS BEEN RESECTED.  
 
SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS, MAY NEED ACTION 
I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agreed
with the report transcribed above.

In the interval, a left chest tube has been placed. Some left
hilar clips are again present. Volume loss is again noted on the
left side. A left apical small to moderate pneumothorax is
present. Minimal left lower lobe atelectasis is present. The left
hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated. The right lung appears clear.
The film is underpenetrated, limiting the ability for
interpretation.

Chest 1 View 6/11/2020
 
Clinical History: 66 years Female with mini sternotomy, evaluate for 
pneumothorax.
 
COMPARISON: CT of the chest, 6-11-2020
 
FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest at 5:37 p.m. demonstrates 
cardiomegaly and a prominent right hilar shadow, which may correlate 
with the previously demonstrated anterior mediastinal mass.  A small 
drain is seen projecting over the sternum.  Three new sternal wires 
are present.  A left retrocardiac opacity is present with blunting of 
the left costophrenic angle suggestive of small effusion.  No obvious 
pneumothorax.  There is indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, 
suggesting mild edema.
 
Subsequent frontal view of the chest at 5:34 a.m. on 20-11 
demonstrates improved lung volumes with improved aeration of the left 
base.  Slight residual blunting of the left costophrenic angle is 
seen.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
1.IMPROVING AERATION OF THE LUNGS.
 
2.NO PNEUMOTHORAX.
 
SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTION
I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agreed
with the report transcribed above.
