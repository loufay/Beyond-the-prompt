RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST: 11/25/2006
 
CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 years of age, Male, Post op CV surgery.
 
COMPARISON: 11/25
 
PROCEDURE COMMENTS: Single view of the chest. 
 
FINDINGS:
 
Stable appearance of median sternotomy wires, atrial appendage clip, 
and LVAD. Interval resolution of pulmonary edema. Small left pleural 
effusion is decreased appearance. Dense left basilar opacities are 
seen and are favored to represent atelectasis over consolidation. 
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1.  Interval resolution of pulmonary edema with decreased small left 
pleural effusion.
2.  Persistent left basilar densities favored to represent 
atelectasis over consolidation.
 
 
I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agreed
with the report transcribed above.
