/CheXpert-v1.0-512/images/train/patient49627/study2/view1_frontal.jpg,"NARRATIVE:
CHEST ONE VIEW: 11/17/13
CLINICAL HISTORY: Lymphoma. Status post line placement. Please
evaluate.
COMPARISON: 11-17-2013.
FINDINGS:
There has been interval exchange of the right interval jugular
central venous line with a right interval jugular Swan-Ganz
catheter with the tip in the proximal right pulmonary artery. The
left upper extremity PICC line has also been advanced again with
the tip now at the cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube and
feeding tube are unchanged in position. There has been slight
interval improvement in airspace disease in both lungs. However,
diffuse airspace disease with peripheral prominence remains. Low
lung volumes persist.
IMPRESSION:
1. INTERVAL EXCHANGE OF RIGHT INTERVAL JUGULAR CENTRAL VENOUS LINE
WITH A RIGHT INTERVAL JUGULAR SWAN-GANZ CATHETER TIP IN THE
PROXIMAL RIGHT PULMONARY ARTERY. NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMOTHORAX.
2. OTHERWISE NO SIGNIFICANT INTERVAL CHANGE, ONLY SLIGHT
IMPROVEMENT OF AIRSPACE DISEASE IN BOTH LUNGS AND MAY REPRESENT
PULMONARY EDEMA, DIFFUSE PNEUMONIA AND/OR DRUG REACTION. ALSO THE
WITH THE FINDING OF PERIPHERAL CONSOLIDATION ONE MUST CONSIDER
ENTITY SUCH AS EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIA.
END OF IMPRESSION:
SUMMARY 4: POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY/CHANGE, MAY NEED
ACTION.
I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree
with the report transcribed above.

PORTABLE CHEST: 1-27-2013.
COMPARISON: 1/27/2013.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Mitral regurgitation.
IMPRESSION:
1. RIGHT INTERNAL JUGULAR SWAN-GANZ CATHETER HAS BEEN REMOVED WITH
NO CHANGE IN POSITION OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL JUGULAR SHEATH,
TERMINATING AT THE PROXIMAL SUPERIOR VENA CAVA. EPICARDIAL PACING
WIRES REMAIN POSITIONED, STATUS POST MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT WITH
INTACT STERNAL WIRES. ENLARGED CARDIAC SILHOUETTE, LIKELY WITH A
COMPONENT OF PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.
2. INTERVAL REMOVAL OF RIGHT CHEST TUBE. NO PNEUMOTHORAX SEEN.
PERSISTENT, BUT SLIGHTLY DECREASED DEGREE OF LEFT GREATER THAN
RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSIONS, ASSOCIATED WITH RETROCARDIAC CONSOLIDATION
AND/OR ATELECTASIS. FOCAL OPACITY AT THE RIGHT LOWER LUNG ZONE,
DECREASING. THIS OPACITY MAY REPRESENT FLUID WITHIN THE MAJOR
FISSURE. ALTERNATIVELY, THIS MAY REFLECT NITUS OF INFECTION VERSUS
ASPIRATION VERSUS CONTUSION.
3. DECREASING PULMONARY EDEMA.
