This region has been questionable on several prior chest radiographs. I am not sure if it is real. The second it is a region of increased radiodensity projecting over the right cardiophrenic sulcus. This is a region where mediastinal fat can simulate lung abnormalities. Chest CT scanning would be definitive in assessing the lungs and detecting infection.
